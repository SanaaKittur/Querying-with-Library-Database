## LIBRARY DATABASE 
### Basic querying with DDL / DML / DQL commands 
* Inserting atleast 10 records in each of the tables
* Retrieve details of all books in the library â€“ id, title, name of the publisher, authors, number of copies in each branch, etc.
* Getting the particulars of borrowers who have borrowed more than 3 books, but from Aug 2019 to Nov 2017
* Deleting a book in BOOK table. 
* Updating the contents of other table to reflect this data manipulation operation.
* Partitioning the BOOK table based on year of publication.
* Creating a view of all books and its number of copies that are currently available in the Library.
### Entity-Relationship Diagram
